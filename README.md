# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Rating Component

This is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Interactive Rating Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUm). The goal of this project was to create a simple and interactive rating component that allows users to submit a rating and receive feedback based on their input.

## Overview

In this challenge, I built an interactive rating component where users can select a rating from 1 to 5, submit their rating, and see the selected rating displayed on the screen. The component uses smooth transitions for better UX, and I focused on keeping the design simple and functional.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a rating from 1 to 5.
- Submit their rating.
- See a thank you message with their selected rating after submitting.
- Have the page transition smoothly between the rating input and the result message.
